indexing types : 
	Clustered Index
	Definition: A clustered index determines the physical order of data in a table. Each table can have 	only one clustered index because the rows themselves are sorted based on this index.

	Characteristics:

	The table data is stored in the order of the index.
	Ideal for columns that are often used in range queries or sorting operations.
	Example: If you create a clustered index on the EmployeeID column of an Employees table, the rows in 	the table will be stored in ascending order of EmployeeID.
